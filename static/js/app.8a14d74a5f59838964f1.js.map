提速降费，提的是企业竞争力，降的是社会总成本。中国电信称，将进一步加快企业转型升级，加快供给侧结构性改革，助力数字中国建设，为广大消费者提供更多用得上、用得起、用得好的智能信息服务，为“建设网络强国、打造一流企业、共筑美好生活”而努力奋斗！</div>\n  \t\t<div>附件：<a style=\"color: #00A5E7;\"

提速降费，提的是企业竞争力，降的是社会总成本。中国电信称，将进一步加快企业转型升级，加快供给侧结构性改革，助力数字中国建设，为广大消费者提供更多用得上、用得起、用得好的智能信息服务，为“建设网络强国、打造一流企业、共筑美好生活”而努力奋斗！</div>\n  \t\t<div>附件：<a style=\"color: #00A5E7;\"
